# Automatic-Music-Synthesizer-Using-Genetic-AI
The "Automatic Music Synthesizer Using AI" stands at the forefront of innovation in the field of automated music composition, introducing a pioneering method driven by genetic algorithms (GAs). Genetic algorithms, inspired by natural selection processes, are employed to iteratively refine, and evolve musical melodies.The emphasis is on adhering to objective criteria such as beauty, harmonics, and rhythmic structure. This approach allows the system to generate compositions that not only meet mathematical criteria but also resonate with the subjective sensibilities of human listeners.

For further information about the project you can just refer the Repoert.pdf and the ai_music_paper.
